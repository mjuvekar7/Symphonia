This repository contains a Java application called 'Symphonia', a simple editor
and synthesizer for sheet music. This application was written by me as my final
Computer Science project for the 10th grade ICSE course.

Please refer to the Users' Guide (an excerpt from the writeup I had to submit
along with the project) for usage instructions.

Unfortunately, I have not ben able to continue development on the project after
10th grade, but I decided to put it up on Github nonetheless. As it stands right
now, the project is not too useful an application, and is (for now) not in
active development.
